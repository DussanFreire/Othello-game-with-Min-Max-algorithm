## Problem description

The problem to resolve consists of programming the game named "Othello" and the "Min-Max (with depth)" algorithm.

The objective of programing these programs is to create a AI which plays Othello against another player. Both players playing the game must have the option to be a user or to be the AI programmed with the "Min-Max" algorithm.
 
After Othello is working correctly and the AI working correctly and is able to play Othello as a player, we have to do the following experiments and modifications:
-  Add the "Prunning" functionality to the Min-Max algorithm.
-  Calculate the average time the AI takes to make its move.
-  Make sure the AI is making a move in less than 15 seconds.
-  Get the total number of expanded states by the AI.

That is basicly the description of the problem and objectives.

The specific requirements are the following:

- The program reports the computer(AI) response time after each turn.
- The program reports the average response time of the computer at the end of the game.
- The program reports the number of black and white tiles that exist on the board at the end of the game, determining a winner.
- The program has an initial menu where you can choose to be black or white.
- The program shows the current state of the board after each turn.
- MinMaxWithDepthest algorithm has been successfully implemented.
- The α β prunning algorithm is properly integrated into the MinMaxWithDepth algorithm as seen in classes.
- Othello is working correctly and accordingly to the official game rules.
